# ReachableCEO Fulltime Resume

## Introduction

This is the resume Charles N Wyble (@ReachableCEO) uses for seeking fulltime employment for systems engineering/SRE/devops roles.

It contains the markdown/csv files that represent his production resume for fulltime employment.

He also has a resume for consulting/freelance work: [here](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/ReachableCEOConsultantResume) and it uses the same structure/process as this one.

Two core artifacts are output from those files by this process:

- PDF/MSWord Resume (auto parsed/populated by all job boards)
- PDF Candidate information sheet (streamlining the initial lead (dis)qualification process.)

## Production use

This resume is live on all the job portals and at:
