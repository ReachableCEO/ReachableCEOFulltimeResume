Hello,

Thank you for writing me in regards to this opportunity.

I apologize for the form letter response. I receive a high volume of recruiter emails every day and I've found this letter to be the most efficient way to
 handle the high volume of emails and reduce back and forth emails/calls.

Re: share my ID:

I WILL NOT share my (full or redacted) photo ID over email or any other electronic written communication. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

I am happy to get on a teams/zoom/google meet etc call and show my ID.

Re: professional references:

I am happy to provide professional references once an interview is scheduled with the end client/customer/hiring manager/team. I will NOT provide references up front. If that is "required" then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

Re relocation (if the role is not based in Austin TX or Raleigh NC I will need to re-locate):

| Question                                  | Answer |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Am I open to relocation?                  | Yes    |
| Am I willing to re-locate at own expense? | No     |
| Am I open to up to 100% travel            | Yes    |

Please be aware that:

- I will **only re-locate at the employer expense**.
- I will need **two weeks of time** to re-locate.
- The net amount of the re-location benefit **MUST be at least $5,000 USD** to fully compensate me for the time/effort to re-locate.
- The full relocation benefit **must be provided 3 weeks or more prior to the confirmed start date**.
- I will **NOT accept** a reimbursement based re-location package.


If all of the above is acceptable, please find my latest resume in PDF format at the following URLs:

- [Long resume](https://resume.reachableceo.com/cv/CharlesNWybleCV.pdf)

Feel free to use either/both for my submission to the job as you feel appropriate.

I will not provide my resume in Microsoft Word format. If that is "required" then i have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

I am happy to make edits to my resume to better fit the position as needed. Just let me know via e-mail.

Re compensation/pay:

Generally I will not have interest in anything less than 65.00 per hour/130k annually. I have some flexibility for fully remote roles that I find interesting.

I am open to w2, corp to corp (I have my own LLC), 1099.  If you have a rate for any/all of those, send them all. If it's a different rate with/without benefits, send both.

If all of the above is in alignment with this opportunity, please feel free to send me an RTR with the best rate you can offer.
