## Introduction

This is the profile that Charles N Wyble (@ReachableCEO) uses for seeking fulltime employment for systems engineering/SRE/devops roles.

It contains the markdown/csv files that represent his production resume for fulltime employment.

He also is building a profile for consulting/freelance work: [here](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/ReachableCEOConsultantResume) and it uses the same structure/process as this one.

Two core artifacts are output by this process:

- PDF/MSWord Resume (auto parsed/populated by all job boards) / PDF Candidate information sheet (streamlining the initial lead (dis)qualification process.)
- JSON resume 

## Production use

This resume is live on all the job portals and at:

- [My hiring site](https://resume.reachableceo.com)
