# Readme for "Joplin"

This directory has exports of my Joplin maintained:

- Candidate information profile
- Comprehensive employment history

I have taken a brief hiatus from maintaining the full blown git based, pandoc client/server based pipeline now that I have less time due to securing a job (been in it a bit over 90 days).

I am experimenting with some major changes to the pipeline (well to the pandoc / latex etc of it all) and need the ability to iterate on my resume/profile in the meantime (as the constantly shifting economy and being under employed necessitates).

The Joplin notebook has my "expanded" information, instead of using YAML/Mustache to keep everything maintained.
