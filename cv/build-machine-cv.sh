#Per platform specific notes....
# Original idea here was to use the CSV file (| separated but whatever) and figure out (per platform) what was needed for formatting to be
# auto parsed
# ie

# function linkedin
# COMPANY=$1
# TITLE=$1
# EMPLOYMENTDATE=$1
# $COMPANY $EMPLYMENTDATE $TITLE

# function glassdoor
# COMPANY=$1
# TITLE=$1
# EMPLOYMENTDATE=$1
# $COMPANY $TITLE $EMPLOYMENTDATE

# This may still be developed

# glassdoor
# Appears to not try to parse.

# indeed
# Appears to not try to parse.

#  ziprecruiter
# ZipRecruiter (position parsing) (fixed manually, only one position wasn't properly captured)

#  linkedin
# TBD, not sure how/if/when it parses the uploaded document...

#  upwork
# Doesn't seem to parse the resume at all

#  roberthalf
# Robert Half (not sure if it parses resume or not)

#  dice
# DIce (skills)

#  teal
# tbd

#  guru
# tbd

# careerbuilder
# tbd

# oracle talent something something (most big companies appear to use this)
# tbd (once i apply for a job somewhere that uses that platform, i will update)
