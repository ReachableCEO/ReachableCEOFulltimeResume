# {{CandidateName}} Candidate Information Sheet

## Introduction

Hello,

I apologize for the form letter response.

I receive a high volume of recruiter emails every day and I've found this letter to be the most efficient way to handle the high volume of emails and reduce back and forth emails/texts/calls.

If you ask me something that is already answered in this document, I will not respond and will not move forward with the opportunity, so please read it in detail!

If you have any questions/comments/concerns not covered by this document, please let me know via e-mail and I'm happy to address them!

## Re: share my ID over email

I am happy to get on a teams/zoom/google meet etc call and show my ID. 

I WILL NOT share my (full or redacted) photo ID over email or any other electronic written  communication. If that is necessary, then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

## Re: professional references

I am happy to provide professional references once an interview with the end client/customer/hiring manager/team has been scheduled.  

I will NOT provide references up front. If that is necessary, then I have no interest in moving forward with this opportunity.

## Re: relocation

If the job is outside the Austin Texas metro area, I will need to re-locate. I can re-locate within four weeks of receiving an employment offer.

I would need (net after taxes/fees etc) at least $5,000.00 dollars for my relocation, paid in full before my start date.

## Rate Schedule (compensation expectations)

I expect positions to pay the prevailing market rate which is **$130,000** to **$180,000 or higher** for senior system admin/engineering roles.

I have some room to be flexible on salary, for the right position (fully remote, fulltime) at my sole discretion.

### Compensation type

In regards to compensation type, I am open to:

- w2
- corp to corp (I have my own LLC)
- 1099  

If you have rate options for any of the compensation types above, please send them all. I will pick which one works best for my situation and the opportunity.

If it's a different rate with/without benefits, send both.

If the above is in alignment with this opportunity, please feel free to send me an RTR with the best rate you can offer.
